## Preface

Do you remember your early days of programming, when an off-by-one error could
take half an hour to track down and fix? As we advance in our programming journey,
one of the most valuable skills we develop is debugging.

Some bugs are easy to spot just by reading the code. Others require running the
program to observe its behavior and pinpoint the issue. Then there are those
elusive bugs that seem to occur randomly, leaving us clueless about their cause
or timing.

For these more complex situations, we need more powerful tools.
[The GNU Project Debugger](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/) (GDB) is one such
tool, offering a robust set of features to help developers diagnose and fix even
the most challenging bugs.

Understanding GDB's capabilities can help you choose the best approach for
debugging complex problems, saving you both time and frustration. Even if you
don't use GDB regularly at work, its features can inspire techniques to improve
your efficiency with other debuggers, like the Visual Studio Debugger.

Another reason to learn GDB is its command-line interface. It's especially useful
in environments where you don't have access to a full-featured IDE.

### About GDBugging 101

This tutorial aims to teach you how to perform all the debugging tasks you're
used to in your IDE's debugger, but using GDB. It will also introduce tools that
are not available in most IDEs or are not accessible through their interfaces.

This is not a comprehensive GDB manual. We won't be covering advanced topics such
as extending GDB with its Python API or other material intended for IDE
developers. For detailed information on every command, option, language that GDB
supports, and all its interfaces, refer to the book
[Debugging with GDB](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/documentation/) by Richard
Stallman, Roland Pesch, Stan Shebs, and many other open-source contributors. This
book goes in-depth on all those topics and can be a valuable resource for further
learning.

In this tutorial, I will introduce you to the most essential tools that will help
you improve your debugging skills in a reasonable amount of time.

### GDBugging 101 Structure

This tutorial is a step-by-step guide to GDB which combines tow approaches to the
topic. In our first approach we start with tools for examining source code, then
progress to techniques for controlling program execution (such as setting
breakpoints and stepping through code), and finally, learn how to manage debugging
sessions and customize the GDB environment.

In our second approch to the topic, we'll start by introducing inferiors (the
programs being debugged in a GDB sessionâ€”yes, you can debug multiple programs at
once), and cover how to switch between them. We'll also explore how to control
threads within each program, both independently and in relation to one another.
Additionally, we'll look at investigating stack frames, examining program
variables, and ultimately delving into the raw memory (the zeros and ones).

The first approach delves into the granular details of your source code, gradually
building up to the broader context of the entire debugging session. The second
approach starts with high-level program constructs like threads and stack frames,
and then dives deeper into the underlying machine code and memory representation.

Everything you need is included here. Just set aside a few days after work to go
through the instructions and experiment on your own. This tutorial assumes you're
using a recent version of Ubuntu, but the commands should work seamlessly on other
platforms as well.

For the impatient, let me start by walking you through a sample debugging session.

## A Sample Run

Lets debug Git! To do so we need to have Git and GDB installed.

```bash
sudo apt-get install git gdb
git --version
# git version 2.43.0
```

The version of your Git installation will become important when we want to fetch
the source code for Git. Now lets run Git under GDB:

```bash
gdb git
# ...
# For help, type "help".
# Type "apropos word" to search for commands related to "word"...
# Reading symbols from git...
#
# This GDB supports auto-downloading debuginfo from the following URLs:
#   <https://debuginfod.ubuntu.com>
Enable debuginfod for this session? (y or [n])
```

Choose `y` to enable `debuginfod`. The installed version of Git lacks debugging
information, such as variable and function names (symbols). With `debuginfod`,
this information can be fetched automatically. It enables us to map machine
instructions in the executable back to the original source code. Alternatively,
you could build the Git executable yourself, including debugging information, but
using `debuginfod` is a faster and more convenient option.

The `gdb git` command does not start the executable automatically. To start the
debugging from the first instruction use GDB's `start` command:

```bash
(gdb) start
# ...
# Temporary breakpoint 1, main (argc=1, argv=0xffffffffeef8)
#     at /usr/src/git-1:2.43.0-1ubuntu7.1/common-main.c:32
# warning: 32     /usr/src/git-1:2.43.0-1ubuntu7.1/common-main.c: No such file or directory
```

Notice the line containing `No such file or directory`. This error occurs because
we don't yet have the source code for Git. To fetch the exact source code
corresponding to your Git version, open another terminal and run the following
command (replace `2.43.0` with your version):

```bash
git clone --depth 1 --branch v2.43.0 https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git
cd git
pwd
# /home/mohammad/git
```

Next, we need to inform GDB where to find the source code. In your GDB session,
run the following command:

```bash
# Run external command using !<cmd>
(gdb) !clear
(gdb) set substitute-path /usr/src/git-1:2.43.0-1ubuntu7.1 /home/mohammad/git
```

The `substitute-path` setting in GDB takes two parameters. Whenever GDB looks for
a path that starts with the first parameter, it substitutes it with the second.

Now, you can start experimenting with GDB:
- Use `list .` (or `l .` for short) to view the next portion of code to be executed.
- Use `list` (or `l` for short) to display more of the source code.
- Use `next` (or `n` for short) to execute the next source line.
- Use `step` (or `s` for short) to step into a function.
- Use `finish` to step out of the current function.
- Use `continue` (or `c` for short) to let the program run freely.
- Use `backtrace` (or `bt` for short) to view the current stack frames.
- Use `quit` (or `q` for short) to exit GDB.

Let's start a new debugging session in our newly fetched Git repository and this
time by providing some arguments to the Git command:

```bash
gdb --args git status

(gdb) pwd
# Working directory /home/mohammad/git.
(gdb) set substitute-path /usr/src/git-1:2.43.0-1ubuntu7.1 /home/mohammad/git
```

Before running the program, let's set a breakpoint and then execute the program:

```bash
(gdb) break cmd_status
(gdb) run
```

Unlike the `start` command, `run` executes the program until it hits a breakpoint.

Using the commands introduced so far, you can explore and understand the Git
source code in great detail. This approach is applicable to other open-source
applications too.

## Source Files

GDB can easily locate the source code when the program is built from source, as
the source path is embedded in the debugging information. You can use the `list`
command (`l` for short) to view the source code. In GDB, you may encounter the
term *locspec*, short for *Location Specification*. It refers to a specific point
in your source or machine code. Many GDB commands accept a *locspec* argument,
which can be provided in various formats, including `linenum`, `filename:linenum`,
`function`, or `filename:function`.

Continuing with our Git example, follow these steps to properly set up our GDB
session:

```bash
pwd
# /home/mohammad/git
git pull --depth=2

# Set the EDITOR environment variable then run GDB
EDITOR=nano gdb --args git show

# In the GDB command line
(gdb) set substitute-path /usr/src/git-1:2.43.0-1ubuntu7.1 /home/mohammad/git
(gdb) break cmd_show
# Breakpoint 1 at 0x94680: file builtin/log.c, line 734.
```

Now, let's use `list` to investigate the code. Just as we set a breakpoint using
function names, we can view the code inside a function:

```bash
(gdb) list cmd_show
```

For certain commands, pressing the return key re-executes the previous command.
With `list`, this allows you to repeatedly display the next portion of code,
continuing from the last displayed position. You can change the direction of
consecutive `list` executions using `list -` to move backward and `list +` to
move forward through the code.

To view the next execution point, use the command `list .` (or `l .` for short).
In our example, since the Git program hasn't been run inside GDB yet, the command
will display a function that executes before `main`. While debugging, you'll
often use `list .` to view the surrounding code at a breakpoint.

The `list` command can be used not only to view functions but also to display
entire files:

```bash
(gdb) show listsize
(gdb) set listsize unlimited
(gdb) set pagination off
(gdb) list diff.h:0
```

However, if you want to examine the entire file, opening it in an editor might be
more practical. Recall that we set the `EDITOR` environment variable earlier. You
can use the `edit` command as follows:

```bash
(gdb) edit diff.c:0
```

In some cases, ambiguity can prevent GDB from displaying the file. Even
specifying the full path may not resolve the issue:

```bash
(gdb) edit /usr/src/git-1:2.43.0-1ubuntu7.1/diff.c:0
```

For functions or file names containing irregular characters, you need to use
explicit location arguments:

```bash
(gdb) edit -source /usr/src/git-1:2.43.0-1ubuntu7.1/diff.c -line 0
```

## Breakpoints

We briefly introduced breakpoints in the [A Sample Run](#a-sample-run) section.
Here, we'll delve deeper into the various ways to set and manage breakpoints, as
well as explore other types of breakpoints designed for specific scenarios.

Use the following commands to manage breakpoints in GDB:

```bash
# Break on a locspec
(gdb) break <locspec>

# Display a list of all breakpoints, watchpoints, and catchpoints
(gdb) info breakpoints

# Remove all breakpoints or specific ones by their IDs
(gdb) delete
(gdb) delete <id>

# Delete any breakpoints at locspec
(gdb) clear <locspec>

# Enable or disable specific breakpoints by their IDs
(gdb) enable <id>
(gdb) disable <id>
```

By using the `ignore` option on a breakpoint, GDB can skip the next few times the
breakpoint is hit.

```bash
# List all breakpoints and their IDs
(gdb) info breakpoints

# Ignore the next n hits of a breakpoint
(gdb) ignore <id> <n>
```

This feature is particularly useful when, for example, you are processing
elements of a list and calling a function for each element, but you're only
interested in a specific one. You can set a breakpoint at the function call and
use the `ignore` option to skip the first `<n>` elements, stopping only when the
desired element is processed.

You can create a **conditional breakpoint** in GDB by specifying a condition in
the `break` command:

```bash
# Create a conditional breakpoint
(gdb) break <locspec> if <expression>

# Add or modify the condition
(gdb) condition <id> <expression>

# Remove the condition
(gdb) condition <id>
```

With a conditional breakpoint, program execution will only stop at the specified
*locspec* if the condition is met. This feature is particularly useful for
isolating specific cases in loops or complex code paths.

GDB allows you to specify a list of commands to execute automatically when a
breakpoint is hit. For example, the following setup instructs GDB to silently
print a variable, enable another breakpoint, and then continue execution whenever
breakpoint `<id>` is hit:

```bash
(gdb) commands <id>
  silent
  print <var>
  enable <id_2>
  continue
end
```

Alternatively, you can use the commands list to reset the ignore count,
effectively creating a breakpoint that only triggers on every n-th hit:

```bash
(gdb) commands <id>
  ignore <id> <n>
end
```

To remove the commands list associated with a breakpoint, set an empty commands
list:

```bash
(gdb) commands <id>
end
```

By adding the `thread` option to the `break` command, you can set a breakpoint
that applies only to a specific thread.

```bash
# List existing threads
(gdb) info threads

# Switch between threads
(gdb) thread <id>

# Set a breakpoint for a specific thread
(gdb) break <locspec> thread <id>
```

This feature is especially useful when debugging multi-threaded programs. For
example, if you're waiting for execution to reach a specific function but that
function is also accessed by other threads, a thread-specific breakpoint ensures
you stop only when the target thread reaches the function. This helps avoid
unnecessary interruptions from other threads. The `thread` argument can be
combined with other options, such as `if` for conditional breakpoints or `ignore`
to skip a specified number of hits.

To save all the breakpoints, watchpoints, catchpoints, and their configurations
(such as conditions, ignore counts, and command lists) in your current debugging
session to a file, use the following command:

```bash
# Save
(gdb) save breakpoints <filename>

# Restore
(gdb) source <filename>
```

### Watchpoints

In addition to breakpoints, you can set a watchpoint to monitor when a variable
or memory address is accessed or modified.

```bash
# Break when a variable changes
(gdb) watch <var>

# Break when data at address changes
(gdb) watch -location *<address>

# Print list of all watchpoints
(gdb) info watchpoints
```

A read watchpoint is particularly useful when you want to track which parts of
the code depend on a variable's value. It allows you to identify and investigate
those areas further.

```bash
# Break when address is accessed
(gdb) awatch -location *<address>

# Break when a variable is read
(gdb) rwatch <var>
```

Watchpoints are a special type of breakpoint. Any of the commands used for
managing regular breakpoints, such as `ignore`, `thread`, or `commands`, also
work for watchpoints.

Now let's use the `rwatch` command to pinpoint when the `git show` command prints
the commit hash. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Set Up the GDB Session**: Start by setting up the GDB session as described
in the [Source Files](#source-files) section.

2. **Locate the Color Structure**: Through investigation, you'll discover that
the colors for various parts of the diff output are stored in a structure called
`diff_colors`. The array element `diff_colors[6]` corresponds to the `COMMIT`
color.

3. **Set the Watchpoint**:
   - First, run the program until the `cmd_show` breakpoint is hit:
     ```bash
     (gdb) run
     ```
   - Then, set a watchpoint to monitor accesses to `diff_colors[6][0]`:
     ```bash
     (gdb) rwatch diff_colors[6][0]
     ```

4. **Continue Execution**:
   - Resume program execution and let it run until the watchpoint is triggered:
     ```bash
     (gdb) continue
     ```

5. **Inspect the Call Stack**:
   - Move up two levels in the stack to identify the context in which the
   watchpoint was triggered (we will learn stack navigation in a later section):
     ```bash
     (gdb) up 2
     ```

6. **View the Relevant Source Code**:
   - Use the `list` command to examine the part of the code where the commit hash
   is printed:
     ```bash
     (gdb) list
     ```

In my Git installation and source code for version 2.43.0, the line
`log-tree.c:746` is responsible for printing the commit hash in yellow color:

```bash
(gdb) up 2
#2 in show_log (opt=0xffffffffdc28) at /usr/src/git-1:2.43.0-1ubuntu7.1/log-tree.c:746
746   fputs(diff_get_color_opt(&opt->diffopt, DIFF_COMMIT), opt->diffopt.file);
```

### Catchpoints

With GDB, you can set catchpoints to break on specific exceptions anywhere in
your code. Here's a summary of the different types:

```bash
# Break when an exception is thrown
(gdb) catch throw <exception>

# Break when an exception is rethrown
(gdb) catch rethrow <exception>

# Break when a catch block is executed
(gdb) catch catch <exception>
```

GDB also supports catchpoints for system calls:

```bash
grep "sleep"  /usr/include/asm-generic/unistd.h

# Break on a specific system call
(gdb) catch syscall sys_nanosleep
(gdb) catch syscall 101

# Break on any system call
(gdb) catch syscall
```

Catchpoints for system calls are particularly useful for monitoring your
software's interactions with the underlying system.

## Execution Control

In the [A Sample Run](#a-sample-run) section, we saw that you can resume
execution after hitting a breakpoint using `continue`, move to the next source
line with `next`, step into a function with `step`, or step out of a function
with `finish`. Additionally, there's a command called `until` that can be very
useful:

- When used at the end of a loop, it runs the loop until it finishes.
- In the context of a recursive function, it continues execution until all
subsequent recursive calls are completed.

This makes `until` a handy tool for bypassing repetitive code structures, such as
loops or recursive calls, without having to manually step through each iteration
or recursion. It can also take a *locspec* argument, which instructs GDB to
continue execution until the specified location is reached.

Additionally, the `step` and `next` commands accept a numerical argument,
allowing you to specify the number of lines to skip before stopping. This can be
useful for quickly advancing through sections of the code without stepping
line-by-line.

For low-level debugging, to step through assembly instructions, you can use the
`stepi` command. In later sections, we will explore how to display instructions
memory. Here's an example of how to properly use `stepi` in a GDB session:

```bash
# Start GDB
gdb <executable>

# Begin the debugging session
(gdb) start

# Display 16 words of instructions around
# the program counter (PC) continuously
(gdb) display /16i $pc

# Step through the next instruction
(gdb) stepi
```

Another command for skipping parts of execution is the `skip` command. Imagine
you've set a breakpoint inside a low-level function, and the code path you're
debugging involves a high-level function calling it. Multiple high-level
functions might call this low-level function, potentially in a loop. While
stepping through and continuing the program execution, you might want to skip all
high-level function calls except one.

In such cases, you can use `skip` to ignore functions based on their file or
specific names:

```bash
# Skip all functions in a specific file
(gdb) skip file <file>

# Skip a function with a specific name
(gdb) skip function <function_name>
```

This allows you to focus on the function calls you care about while avoiding
unnecessary interruptions from other calls.

## Sessions

It's common during debugging to carefully follow a precise execution path to
recreate a faulty situation for investigation. However, mistakes happenâ€”like
accidentally stepping over a function that modifies critical dataâ€”forcing you to
start over and recreate the conditions.

To address this, GDB provides **checkpoints**, allowing you to save the state of
your program and debugging session. If something goes wrong, you can restore a
checkpoint and continue from there:

```bash
# List all the checkpoints
(gdb) info checkpoints

# Create a checkpoint of the current state
(gdb) checkpoint

# Restore a checkpoint by its ID
(gdb) restart <checkpoint-id>
```

This feature can save significant time and effort during complex debugging
sessions.

## Inferiors

## Threads

By default, when a breakpoint is hit, GDB stops all threads in the program.
However, you can configure GDB to stop only the thread that hits the breakpoint
using the following commands:

```bash
# Disable output pagination for uninterrupted debugging
(gdb) set pagination off

# Enable non-stop mode
(gdb) set non-stop on

# Manually stop all threads if needed
(gdb) interrupt -a

# List existing threads
(gdb) info threads

# Switch between threads
(gdb) thread <id>
```

This approach is particularly useful when debugging a running program that cannot
be fully stopped, such as a server handling live requests. 

From a design perspective, threads within a program should be as isolated as
possible from one another. The behavior of your program should not rely on
precise timing between threads, as this can lead to extremely difficult-to-debug
issues. Testing this can be done by stopping one thread and allowing others to
continue running while you debug specific portions of the code.

## Frames

## Expressions

Most debuggers provide the ability to list elements of arrays in your program.
But what if an array contains pointers to a base type, and you want to inspect
each derived object it points to? GDB makes this possible by allowing you to
write `while` loops to iterate over expressions:

```bash
# Initialize an index variable
(gdb) set $i = 0

# Iterate through the array
(gdb) while ($i < <array-length>)
  print -pretty -object -- /x *(array[$i++])
  end
```

This approach lets you dynamically inspect the content of pointer-based arrays,
including dereferencing and viewing the derived objects.

## Macros

GDB includes a powerful tool specifically designed for debugging C/C++ macros.
With the `macro` command, you can examine the expanded result of any macro with
given parameters, even if the program is not running. Below is an example C++
program featuring two macros, where one macro calls another.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// Macro to add file and line information
#define FILE_LINE "[" << __FILE__ << ":" << __LINE__ << "] "

// Macro to log a message with file and line info
#define LOG_MESSAGE(msg) \
    std::cout << FILE_LINE << msg << std::endl;

int main() {
    int value = 42;
    LOG_MESSAGE("The value is " << value);
    return 0;
}
```

Compile your program with the necessary flags to include macro information in the
debug symbols:

```bash
g++ -gdwarf-5 -g3 main.cpp -o main
```

And in a GDB session:

```bash
(gdb )macro expand LOG_MESSAGE(test)
# expands to: std::cout << "[" << "/home/mohammad/main.cpp" << ":" << 17 << "] " << test << std::endl;
```

## Memory
