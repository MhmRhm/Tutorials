## Preface

Do you remember your early days of programming, when an off-by-one error could
take half an hour to track down and fix? As we advance in our programming journey,
one of the most valuable skills we develop is debugging.

Some bugs are easy to spot just by reading the code. Others require running the
program to observe its behavior and pinpoint the issue. Then there are those
elusive bugs that seem to occur randomly, leaving us clueless about their cause
or timing.

For these more complex situations, we need more powerful tools.
[The GNU Project Debugger](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/) (GDB) is one such
tool, offering a robust set of features to help developers diagnose and fix even
the most challenging bugs.

Understanding GDB's capabilities can help you choose the best approach for
debugging complex problems, saving you both time and frustration. Even if you
don't use GDB regularly at work, its features can inspire techniques to improve
your efficiency with other debuggers, like the Visual Studio Debugger.

Another reason to learn GDB is its command-line interface. It’s especially useful
in environments where you don’t have access to a full-featured IDE.

### About GDBugging 101

This tutorial aims to teach you how to perform all the debugging tasks you’re
used to in your IDE’s debugger, but using GDB. It will also introduce tools that
are not available in most IDEs or are not accessible through their interfaces.

This is not a comprehensive GDB manual. We won’t be covering advanced topics such
as extending GDB with its Python API or other material intended for IDE
developers. For detailed information on every command, option, language that GDB
supports, and all its interfaces, refer to the book
[Debugging with GDB](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/documentation/) by Richard
Stallman, Roland Pesch, Stan Shebs, and many other open-source contributors. This
book goes in-depth on all those topics and can be a valuable resource for further
learning.

In this tutorial, I will introduce you to the most essential tools that will help
you improve your debugging skills in a reasonable amount of time.

### GDBugging 101 Structure

This tutorial is structured to guide you step by step, starting with your source
code. It introduces tools for investigating the code, then progresses to tools
for controlling program execution, and finally covers managing debugging sessions.
It takes you from deep code analysis to handling entire debugging sessions.

Next, we shift focus from the top level to dive deeper into a program, its data,
and assembly code. We’ll start by introducing inferiors (the programs being
debugged in a GDB session—yes, you can debug multiple programs at once), and
cover how to switch between them. We’ll also explore how to control threads
within each program, both independently and in relation to one another.
Additionally, we’ll look at investigating stack frames, examining program
variables, and ultimately delving into the raw memory (the zeros and ones).

All the material you need is here. You just need to dedicate a few days after
work to go through the instructions and experiment on your own.

For the impatient, let’s start by walking through a sample debugging session.

## A Sample Run

## Source Files

## Breakpoints

By adding the `thread` option to the `break` command, you can set a breakpoint that applies only to a specific thread.

```bash
# List existing threads
(gdb) info threads

# Switch between threads
(gdb) thread <id>

# Set a breakpoint for a specific thread
(gdb) break <locspec> thread <id>
```

This feature is especially useful when debugging multi-threaded programs. For example, if you're waiting for execution to reach a specific function but that function is also accessed by other threads, a thread-specific breakpoint ensures you stop only when the target thread reaches the function. This helps avoid unnecessary interruptions from other threads.

By using the `ignore` option on a breakpoint, GDB can skip the next few times the breakpoint is hit.

```bash
# List all breakpoints and their IDs
(gdb) info breakpoints

# Ignore the next n hits of a breakpoint
(gdb) ignore <id> <n>
```

This feature is particularly useful when, for example, you are processing elements of a list and calling a function for each element, but you’re only interested in a specific one. You can set a breakpoint at the function call and use the `ignore` option to skip the first `<n>` elements, stopping only when the desired element is processed.

In addition to breakpoints, you can set a watchpoint to monitor when a variable or memory address is accessed or modified.

```bash
# Break when a variable is read
(gdb) rwatch <var>
```

A read watchpoint is particularly useful when you want to track which parts of the code depend on a variable’s value. It allows you to identify and investigate those areas further.

With GDB, you can set catchpoints to break on specific exceptions in your code. Here’s a summary of the different types:

```bash
# Break when an exception is thrown
(gdb) catch throw <exception>

# Break when an exception is rethrown
(gdb) catch rethrow <exception>

# Break when a catch block is executed
(gdb) catch catch <exception>
```

GDB also supports catchpoints for system developers:

```bash
# Break on a specific system call
# System call list: /usr/include/asm-generic/unistd.h
(gdb) catch syscall <system-call>
```

Catchpoints for system calls are particularly useful for monitoring your software’s interactions with the underlying system.

GDB allows you to specify a list of commands to execute automatically when a breakpoint is hit. For example, the following setup instructs GDB to silently print a variable, enable another breakpoint, and then continue execution whenever breakpoint `<id>` is hit:

```bash
(gdb) commands <id>
  silent
  print <var>
  enable <id_2>
  continue
end
```

## Execution Control

In GDB, you can resume execution after hitting a breakpoint using `continue`, move to the next source line with `next`, step into a function with `step`, or step out of a function with `finish`. Additionally, there’s a command called `until` that can be very useful in specific situations:

- When used at the end of a loop, it runs the loop until it finishes.  
- In the context of a recursive function, it continues execution until all subsequent recursive calls are completed.

This makes `until` a handy tool for skipping over repetitive code structures without stepping through each iteration or recursion manually.

Another powerful tool for skipping parts of execution is the `skip` command. Imagine you’ve set a breakpoint inside a low-level function, and the code path you’re debugging involves a high-level function calling it. Multiple high-level functions might call this low-level function, potentially in a loop. While stepping through and continuing the program execution, you might want to skip all high-level function calls except one.

In such cases, you can use `skip` to ignore functions based on their file or specific names:

```bash
# Skip all functions in a specific file
(gdb) skip file <file>

# Skip a function with a specific name
(gdb) skip function <function_name>
```

This allows you to focus on the function calls you care about while avoiding unnecessary interruptions from other calls.

## Sessions

It’s common during debugging to carefully follow a precise execution path to recreate a faulty situation for investigation. However, mistakes happen—like accidentally stepping over a function that modifies critical data—forcing you to start over and recreate the conditions.

To address this, GDB provides **checkpoints**, allowing you to save the state of your program and debugging session. If something goes wrong, you can restore a checkpoint and continue from there:

```bash
# List all the checkpoints
(gdb) info checkpoints

# Create a checkpoint of the current state
(gdb) checkpoint

# Restore a checkpoint by its ID
(gdb) restart <checkpoint-id>
```

This feature can save significant time and effort during complex debugging sessions.

## Inferiors

## Threads

By default, when a breakpoint is hit, GDB stops all threads in the program. However, you can configure GDB to stop only the thread that hits the breakpoint using the following commands:

```bash
# Disable output pagination for uninterrupted debugging
(gdb) set pagination off

# Enable non-stop mode
(gdb) set non-stop on

# Manually stop all threads if needed
(gdb) interrupt -a

# List existing threads
(gdb) info threads

# Switch between threads
(gdb) thread <id>
```

This approach is particularly useful when debugging a running program that cannot be fully stopped, such as a server handling live requests. 

From a design perspective, threads within a program should be as isolated as possible from one another. The behavior of your program should not rely on precise timing between threads, as this can lead to extremely difficult-to-debug issues. Testing this can be done by stopping one thread and allowing others to continue running while you debug specific portions of the code.

## Frames

## Expressions

Most debuggers provide the ability to list elements of arrays in your program. But what if an array contains pointers to a base type, and you want to inspect each derived object it points to? GDB makes this possible by allowing you to write `while` loops to iterate over expressions:

```bash
# Initialize an index variable
(gdb) set $i = 0

# Iterate through the array
(gdb) while ($i < <array-length>)
  print -pretty -object -- /x *(array[$i++])
  end
```

This approach lets you dynamically inspect the content of pointer-based arrays, including dereferencing and viewing the derived objects.

## Macros

GDB includes a powerful tool specifically designed for debugging C/C++ macros. With the `macro` command, you can examine the expanded result of any macro with given parameters, even if the program is not running. Below is an example C++ program featuring two macros, where one macro calls another.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// Macro to add file and line information
#define FILE_LINE "[" << __FILE__ << ":" << __LINE__ << "] "

// Macro to log a message with file and line info
#define LOG_MESSAGE(msg) \
    std::cout << FILE_LINE << msg << std::endl;

int main() {
    int value = 42;
    LOG_MESSAGE("The value is " << value);
    return 0;
}
```

Compile your program with the necessary flags to include macro information in the debug symbols:

```bash
g++ -gdwarf-5 -g3 main.cpp -o main
```

And in a GDB session:

```bash
(gdb )macro expand LOG_MESSAGE(test)
# expands to: std::cout << "[" << "/home/mohammad/main.cpp" << ":" << 17 << "] " << test << std::endl;
```
