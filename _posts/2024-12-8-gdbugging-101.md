## Preface

Do you remember your early days of programming, when an off-by-one error could
take half an hour to track down and fix? As we advance in our programming journey,
one of the most valuable skills we develop is debugging.

Some bugs are easy to spot just by reading the code. Others require running the
program to observe its behavior and pinpoint the issue. Then there are those
elusive bugs that seem to occur randomly, leaving us clueless about their cause
or timing.

For these more complex situations, we need more powerful tools.
[The GNU Project Debugger](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/) (GDB) is one such
tool, offering a robust set of features to help developers diagnose and fix even
the most challenging bugs.

Understanding GDB's capabilities can help you choose the best approach for
debugging complex problems, saving you both time and frustration. Even if you
don't use GDB regularly at work, its features can inspire techniques to improve
your efficiency with other debuggers, like the Visual Studio Debugger.

Another reason to learn GDB is its command-line interface. It’s especially useful
in environments where you don’t have access to a full-featured IDE.

### About GDBugging 101

This tutorial aims to teach you how to perform all the debugging tasks you’re
used to in your IDE’s debugger, but using GDB. It will also introduce tools that
are not available in most IDEs or are not accessible through their interfaces.

This is not a comprehensive GDB manual. We won’t be covering advanced topics such
as extending GDB with its Python API or other material intended for IDE
developers. For detailed information on every command, option, language that GDB
supports, and all its interfaces, refer to the book
[Debugging with GDB](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/documentation/) by Richard
Stallman, Roland Pesch, Stan Shebs, and many other open-source contributors. This
book goes in-depth on all those topics and can be a valuable resource for further
learning.

In this tutorial, I will introduce you to the most essential tools that will help
you improve your debugging skills in a reasonable amount of time.

### GDBugging 101 Structure

This tutorial is structured to guide you step by step, starting with your source
code. It introduces tools for investigating the code, then progresses to tools
for controlling program execution, and finally covers managing debugging sessions.
It takes you from deep code analysis to handling entire debugging sessions.

Next, we shift focus from the top level to dive deeper into a program, its data,
and assembly code. We’ll start by introducing inferiors (the programs being
debugged in a GDB session—yes, you can debug multiple programs at once), and
cover how to switch between them. We’ll also explore how to control threads
within each program, both independently and in relation to one another.
Additionally, we’ll look at investigating stack frames, examining program
variables, and ultimately delving into the raw memory (the zeros and ones).

All the material you need is here. You just need to dedicate a few days after
work to go through the instructions and experiment on your own.

For the impatient, let’s start by walking through a sample debugging session.
